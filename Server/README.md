# Server

The server will be:
* Handling inter-DNA communication
* Handling initial distribution of:
  * DNA
  * Challenges
  * Client updates
  * HMACs for distributed information
* Keeping track of:
  * Achievements, contributions and scores (both global and per-user)
  * The best DNA from each cycle
  * Violations and bans
  * User IDs
* Testing received DNA to verify their scores and achievements (the tests are assigned to random clients)
* Choosing which DNAs to distribute
* Generating new Huffman trees based on received DNA
