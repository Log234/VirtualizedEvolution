# Challenges and goals

## Challenges
Each challenge is a file describing a task for the DNA to complete, the permitted results, the number of points and the associated achievement gained when successfully completing it.

## Goals
The goals do not contain any tasks themselves, but rather a list of challenges and/or goals to complete which, if all successful, awards the completion rewards.

## Templates
We will need a challenge and a goal template which shall be used when developing the actual challenges and goals.
We will also need a list of example rewards as a guideline that can help maintaining a balanced reward system.
